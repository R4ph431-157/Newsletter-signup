This is a solution to the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and Form validation)

### What I learned

When I first saw this challenge on Frontend Mentor, it looked really intimidating especially for the fact that it was my first JavaScript challenge.
After wrapping up the first try I had to break everything down and rebuild back for mobile-first workflow, because someone had recommended I go with building mobile first,
the challenge pushed me to think deeply and put the knowledge from my JavaScript classes together, then calmly pseudo-code before writing down (as Leon from 100Devs has always told us to).
I had to break everything down logically, research where needed, and, most importantly, understand how everything works.

- I learned to always go with the mobile-first workflow
- Make my code responsive with `rem` for `font-size` instead of `px`
- Make use of `rem` for `min-width` in media query instead of `px` and `max-width`

### Useful resources

- [Fedmentor.dev/ ](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/responsive-meaning/) - This is an amazing reference which helped me understand why I shouldn't use pixels for `font-size` and some approaches for making a site responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to find their way about making a site responsive.
